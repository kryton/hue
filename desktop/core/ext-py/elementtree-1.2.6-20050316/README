XML processing in Python.

For more information on this library, see:

    docs/index.html
    http://effbot.org/zone/element.htm

CHANGES                       List of changes in this release.

elementtree/

  ElementTree.py              Element tree implementation.  For a minimal
                              install, this file is all you need.

  ElementPath.py              Element path support module.  Adds limited
                              XPath support to find/findtext/findall.

  ElementInclude.py           Element include support module.  Adds limited
                              XInclude support.

  HTMLTreeBuilder.py          Element tree builder for HTML.  This only
                              works for mostly well-formed HTML; if you
                              need something that can parse arbitrary
                              HTML at least as good as your browser, use
                              TidyHTMLTreeBuilder or TidyTools (see below).

  XMLTreeBuilder.py           Element tree builder for XML (compatibility;
                              new code should use the tree builder in the
                              ElementTree module).

  TidyHTMLTreeBuilder.py      Element tree builder for HTML, based on the
                              tidylib library.  This tree builder requires
                              the _elementtidy extension module (available
                              from http://effbot.org/downloads).

  SimpleXMLTreeBuilder.py     Old element tree builder for XML, based on
                              xmllib, for Python versions where "expat" is
                              not available.   Due to bugs in xmllib, the
                              namespace support is not reliable (run the
                              module as a script to find out exactly how
                              unreliable it is on your Python version...)

  SgmlopXMLTreeBuilder.py     Simple element tree builder based on the
                              SGMLOP parser.  Note: The current version
                              does not support namespaces.

  SimpleXMLWriter.py          Simple XML writer

  TidyTools.py                Build element trees from HTML, using the
                              external 'tidy' utility.
