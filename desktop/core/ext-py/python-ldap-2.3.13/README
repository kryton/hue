python-ldap: LDAP client API for Python
---------------------------------------

What is python-ldap?

python-ldap provides an object-oriented API to access LDAP
directory servers from Python programs. Mainly it wraps the
OpenLDAP client libs for that purpose.

Additionally the package contains modules for other LDAP-related
stuff (e.g. processing LDIF, LDAPURLs, LDAPv3 sub-schema, etc.).

Not included: Direct BER support

See INSTALL for version compability

See TODO for planned features. Contributors welcome.

For module documentation, see:

	http://www.python-ldap.org/

Quick usage example:
    import ldap
    l = ldap.initialize("ldap://my_ldap_server.my_domain")
    l.simple_bind_s("","")
    l.search_s("o=My Organisation, c=AU", ldap.SCOPE_SUBTREE, "objectclass=*")

See directory Demo/ of source distribution package for more
example code.
