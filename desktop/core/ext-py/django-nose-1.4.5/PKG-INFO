        django-nose
        ===========
        
        
        **django-nose** provides all the goodness of `nose`_ in your Django tests, like:
        
          * Testing just your apps by default, not all the standard ones that happen to
            be in ``INSTALLED_APPS``
          * Running the tests in one or more specific modules (or apps, or classes, or
            folders, or just running a specific test)
          * Obviating the need to import all your tests into ``tests/__init__.py``.
            This not only saves busy-work but also eliminates the possibility of
            accidentally shadowing test classes.
          * Taking advantage of all the useful `nose plugins`_

        .. _nose plugins: http://nose-plugins.jottit.com/
        
        It also provides:
        
          * Fixture bundling, an optional feature which speeds up your fixture-based
            tests by a factor of 4
          * Reuse of previously created test DBs, cutting 10 seconds off startup time
          * Hygienic TransactionTestCases, which can save you a DB flush per test
          * Support for various databases. Tested with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
            Others should work as well.
        
        django-nose requires nose 1.2.1 or later, and the `latest release`_ is
        recommended.  It follows the `Django's support policy`_, supporting:
        
          * Django 1.8 (LTS) with Python 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5
          * Django 1.9 with Python 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5
          * Django 1.10 with Python 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5
          * Django 1.11 (LTS) with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6

        1.1 (2012-05-19)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        * Django TransactionTestCases don't clean up after themselves; they leave
          junk in the DB and clean it up only on ``_pre_setup``. Thus, Django makes
          sure these tests run last. Now django-nose does, too. This means one fewer
          source of failures on existing projects. (Erik Rose)
        * Add support for hygienic TransactionTestCases. (Erik Rose)
        * Support models that are used only for tests. Just put them in any file
          imported in the course of loading tests. No more crazy hacks necessary.
          (Erik Rose)
        * Make the fixture bundler more conservative, fixing some conceivable
          situations in which fixtures would not appear as intended if a
          TransactionTestCase found its way into the middle of a bundle. (Erik Rose)
        * Fix an error that would surface when using SQLAlchemy with connection
          pooling. (Roger Hu)
        * Gracefully ignore the new ``--liveserver`` option introduced in Django 1.4;
          don't let it through to nose. (Adam DePue)
        
        1.0 (2012-03-12)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        * New fixture-bundling plugin for avoiding needless fixture setup (Erik Rose)
        * Moved FastFixtureTestCase in from test-utils, so now all the
          fixture-bundling stuff is in one library. (Erik Rose)
        * Added the REUSE_DB setting for faster startup and shutdown. (Erik Rose)
        * Fixed a crash when printing options with certain verbosities. (Daniel Abel)
        * Broke hard dependency on MySQL. Support PostgreSQL. (Roger Hu)
        * Support SQLite, both memory- and disk-based. (Roger Hu and Erik Rose)
        * Nail down versions of the package requirements. (Daniel Mizyrycki)
