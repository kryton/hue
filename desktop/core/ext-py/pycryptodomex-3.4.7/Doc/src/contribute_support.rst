Contribute and support
======================

- Do not be afraid to contribute with small and apparently insignificant
  improvements like correction to typos. Every change counts.
- Read carefully the :doc:`license` of PyCryptodome. By submitting your code,
  you acknowledge that you accept to release it according to the `BSD 2-clause license`_.
- You must disclaim which parts of your code in your contribution were partially
  copied or derived from an existing source. Ensure that the original is licensed
  in a way compatible to the *BSD 2-clause license*.
- You can propose changes in any way you find most convenient.
  However, the preferred approach is to:

  * Clone the main repository on `GitHub`_.
  * Create a branch and modify the code. 
  * Send a `pull request`_ upstream with a meaningful description.

- Provide tests (in ``Crypto.SelfTest``) along with code. If you fix a bug
  add a test that fails in the current version and passes with your change.
- If your change breaks backward compatibility, hightlight it and include
  a justification.
- Ensure that your code complies to `PEP8`_ and `PEP257`_.
- Ensure that your code does not use constructs or includes modules not
  present in `Python 2.4`_.
- Add a short summary of the change to the file ``Changelog.rst``.
- Add your name to the list of contributors in the file ``AUTHORS.rst``.
