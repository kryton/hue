HUE v1.0, released Aug 13, 2010
===============================

HUE is a web interface for Hadoop, and a platform for building custom
applications with a rich framework. The 1.0 release delivers several new
features:

* File Browser and Beeswax has basic internationalization (i18n) support. UTF-8
  works well. Data in other encoding show up with replacement characters.
* HUE automatically validates its configuration, detects errors and alerts the
  administrator.
* File Browser can now handle viewing large directories.
* There is a centralized logging mechanism of front-end errors to help debugging.
* Tables now support multi-select for bulk operations. Also added support
  for +shift+\+select and +shift++keyboard controls.
* Art buttons can be disabled.

The majority of bug fixes in HUE 1.0 are for small UI glitches across different
browsers. To highlight some other key areas:

* Made keyboard shortcuts more consistent across operating systems.
* Improved window sizing to better handle a small browser window.
* Continuous improvement on Internet Explorer 8.
* Improved documentation.


Application Compatibility
-------------------------

The Hadoop file system library (+hadoop.fs.hadoopfs+) now takes and returns
unicode strings for all file paths. Other than that, HUE 1.0 is compatible with
applications written for HUE 0.9.x.

At the UI framework level, we migrated most elements from JFrame filters to
Behaviour. This allows us to manage memory better and scale better as we
introduce more behaviour patterns. The changes are backward compatible, but SDK
developers should start using the new behaviour patterns. We have updated the
JFrame Gallery examples, and added new ones, to demonstrate the usage.
